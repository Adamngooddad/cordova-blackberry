# BlackBerry Widget Packager Directory
#
#   The Widget Packager SDK can be the Standalone SDK or the Eclipse Widget plugin.
#
#   The standalone SDK will be located somewhere such as:
#     C:\Program Files (x86)\Research In Motion\BlackBerry Widget Packager
#
#   The Eclipse Widget plugin will be located somewhere such as:
#     C:\Eclipse-3.5.2\plugins\net.rim.browser.tools.wcpc_1.0.0.201003191451-126\wcpc
#
#   The ANT script is brittle and requires you to escape the backslashes.
#     e.g. C:\some\path must be C:\\some\\path
#
#   Please remember to:
#     - Double escape your backslahses (i.e. \ must be \\)
#     - Do not add a trailing slash (e.g. C:\some\path)
